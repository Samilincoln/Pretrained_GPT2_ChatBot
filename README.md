# Pretrained_GPT2_ChatBot

This project demonstrates a chatbot built using a pretrained GPT-2 model. The chatbot leverages the power of GPT-2 to generate human-like responses in a conversational setting.

## Features
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-2 model for natural language processing.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- Customizable for various conversational use cases.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pretrained_GPT2_ChatBot.git
    cd Pretrained_GPT2_ChatBot
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the chatbot script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

2. Interact with the chatbot in the terminal or through the provided interface.

## Customization
You can fine-tune the GPT-2 model or modify the chatbot's behavior by editing the `chatbot.py` script and related configuration files.
